# This is a slimmed down version of KrakenDash
 I removed the Ops portion, because I just want a slick UI to get status from and pull json data from.

    I refactored this app to run in a fedora docker container, and as long as you use the commands below, your dashboard should just work.
    I changed the default ports for the app so they don't conflict with an Openstack deployment 

# KrakenCeph 
This can be used to monitor your Ceph Cluster, and hook into your NMS

## Overview

![Status dashboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnydavis/krakendash/master/screenshots/status.png "Status") 



## Installation and Roadmap


This is used to build a docker image which can be found here https://hub.docker.com/r/automatikdonn/krakenceph/

Install docker on your mon hosts, create a directory to mount the ceph configurations (I used /mnt/krakenceph as $target_dir) 

Copy and Paste directions are below

You will need to adjust your own firewall settings to allow port 9091 through
```
firewall-cmd --add-port=9091/tcp
firewall-cmd --add-port=9091/tcp --permanent
```
```
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 9091 -j ACCEPT
iptables-save | tee /etc/sysconfig/iptables
systemctl restart iptables
```
## The variable doesn't work with the selinux commands. If you change the directory, don't forget to change them in the semanage and restorecon commands


MON host setup is as follows
```
yum -y install docker rsync
systemctl enable docker
systemctl start docker
export target_dir=/mnt/krakenceph
mkdir $target_dir
rsync -axv /etc/ceph/ $target_dir
chmod -R 600 $target_dir
semanage fcontext -a -t svirt_sandbox_file_t "/mnt/krakenceph(/.*)?"
restorecon -Rv /mnt/krakenceph
docker run --name krakenceph -d -v $target_dir:/etc/ceph -p 9091:9091 automatikdonn/krakenceph /bin/sh -c /app/contrib/startall.sh
```
